# Bugs in Magellan

For us as developers the error messages are a good start
when tackling a problem. These can be found in the
`errors.txt`
file in the Magellan folder; please include these error
messages if you have a problem with Magellan. To
reproduce an error it may prove necessary to send in (an
excerpt of) the used CR. These CRs are of course handled
confidentially, and will be deleted after the issue has
been resolved.

## Feature wishes = further development

We try to develop Magellan according to the wishes of its users. Our bug tracker helps enormously in this, because  all feature wishes are centrally and publicly available.
