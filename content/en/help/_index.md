<h1>Magellan Help</h1>

<p>Magellan is a complete client for Eressea. You can view your
    map, search, give orders, and you almost only need to leave the
    program to send mails to your allies. Almost...</p>
<p>This documentation is built up around the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="menus/">The menus</a>
    <li><a href="docks/">The docks</a>
    <li><a href="reference/">Reference</a>
    <li><a href="/en/faq/">FAQ</a>
    <li><a href="/en/feedback/">Feedback and Support</a>
</ul>

<p>
    In the JavaHelp version there are some additional tables and
    descriptions of the orders from the Eressea manual. These may,
    however, not be complete or completely up-to-date. When in doubt
    use the official rules at <a href="https://wiki.eressea.de/index.php/Regeln">https://wiki.eressea.de</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately this documentation is incomplete. Several parts
    are missing or have to be expanded on. It may also happen that
    this documentation is not completely up-to-date, since Magellan
    is under constant development. If you miss anything, leave us a note
    at the <a
  href="feedback/#bugs">Magellan bug tracker</a>. Of course any kind of help is welcome. The most
    important resource for recent information is our Website: <br />

<h3>Thank you</h3>

    cool Eressa-client and the support for this online help and to
    Matthias Müller, who helped me with texts and tests.</p>
