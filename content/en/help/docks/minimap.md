<img src="/images/help/magellan/windows_minimap.gif" data-border="0" />

This map shows an eagle's eye view, making it possible to see a larger
portion of the world. If a region is selected here, the main map will be
centered on this region, and the region will be opened in the region
tree. As with the main map, the MiniMap offers a range of
[options](../menus/extras/options_map/).
