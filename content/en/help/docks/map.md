Here the map of the known world is displayed.

When "Fog of War" (FOW) is enabled, regions that do not contain units or
have not been traveled through, as well as ocean regions that can not be
glimpsed from atop a lighthouse, are displayed darker. This mode can be
toggled with shortcut key **CTRL-W**.

If you click on the map the selected region is opened in the region
view. By holding down the mouse button you can pan the map.

Above the map there is a zoombar that controls the magnification of the
map. Additionally you might find two drop-down menus here. One for
planes, if you happen to have units in several planes, and one that
allows you to choose so-called HotSpots. You can add a HotSpot by
pressing **CTRL-H** and entering a name. By doing this you save the
current map position and can go back to it at any time through the
drop-down menu. If you are at an existing HotSpot, you can delete it by
pressing **CTRL-ALT-H**.

By clicking on a region while holding down the CTRL-key you can select a
region, or several with the mouse button held down. This way you can for
example select regions to export as a CR. To deselect, click again with
the CTRL-key held down.

Rightclicking a region results in a context menu that has the following
options:

- **Change selection state**  
  Allows you to select and deselect the current region like you were
  clicking it with the CTRL-key presded.
- **Copy name and coordinates**  
  Copies the name and coordinates to the clipboard.
- **Set origin to this region**  
  Sets the origin of the coordinate system to the current region. This
  only applies to the display, a matching ORIGIN order is not issued to
  any unit.
- **Set or delete hotspot**  
  Sets or deletes a hotspot corresponding to the current region. The
  name of the hotspot is set to the region's name.
