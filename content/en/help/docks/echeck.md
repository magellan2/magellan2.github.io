# E-Check

From here one can run E-Check, the Eressea order checker. E-Check can be
downloaded at <http://echeck.faroul.de/>. A manual can be found there,
as well.

Clicking on the menu entry shows the following dialog:

At the top one can enter the path to E-Check. Additional options can be
entered directly. The list of possible options can be found in E-Check's
documentation.

When you click on ***Run*** the orders are checked. The resulting
warnings and errors are shown in the window. By clicking on an error or
warning you can jump to the corresponding unit so you can have another
look at the orders.
