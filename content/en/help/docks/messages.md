Messages are shown here depending on the context. If a unit is selected,
this window shows messages that relate to this unit (transactions,
errors, messages to this unit, effects). If your faction is selected,
all messages in the whole report are displayed. For a selected region
this window shows the region messages (effects, silver received, unit
that traveled through the region). For a selected building or ship the
effects, if any, are shown.

With every message the corresponding units can be shown, and by
doubleclicking you can jump to these units.
