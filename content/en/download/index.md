# Download

On this page you can find all available downloads for Magellan. Except for Magellan 1.x, all JAR files are executable. Magellan 2.x, and the plugins are divided into multiple files that can be installed in any directory (for example also on a USB stick).

# Installation

From version 2.1.0 (build 752) on, after downloading the installer for your operating system, simply run the executable file `Magellan_installer...`

The installer will install all necessary files and, if you want, links on your desktop and the start menu. To execute Magellan, simply use this link or run the file magellan_launcher in the magellan directory You may edit the file `magellan_launcher.vmoptions` if you have special needs, for example with regards to memory. Usually this isn't necessary.

Up to and including version 2.0.9 you have to install [Java](/en/#java) first, then run the Magellan installer by simply double clicking the file magellan_vX.Y.Z.jar or running the command `java -jar magellan_vX.Y.Z`. You would then run the Magellan itself by using the links or starting magellan.bat or magellan.sh.
  
  
A Java version is installed by the installer if necessary. You can find more information on Java on the [main page](/en/#java).

Our installer has been generated by the multi platform installer builder [install4j](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html).
