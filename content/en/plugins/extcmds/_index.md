The Extended Commands (or ExtCmds, for short) are a plugin allowing you to automate your or units' orders (or "script" them). I resembles [Vorlage](http://www.gulrak.net/wiki/view/Gulrak/EresseaTools#vorlage), but there are two important differences:

First, scripts are more focused on units. That is, you may chose a unit, write a script for it, and execute it later. Second, ExtCmds use JShell, so they are very Java-like. You can access all the functionality available to Magellan to analyze your report.

Although the intention was to write scripts for singular units, you may also write a script for a so-called container. A container contains units and can be a region, a faction, a ship. You can also write your own global library that contains functions you can use in your other scripts.
